## Day 3
Today I made the page for the specific information and I added the same style to it as the
homepage (via bootstrap). I did this because it makes it look better. See picture below

I also divided my homepage in 2 columns, I decided to go for 2 columns because I can now
display the worldmap and the interactive chart set next to each other.

I formatted my csv data into a json file, via my converter (I adjusted the converter
I made in previous projects to fit on my current data).

Lastly I added the worldmap to my homepage (worldmap-page), and I puzzled a bit
such that now only Europe is displayed as I wanted. I added colours, but not the right one.
Tomorrow I want to figure out which colours I'm going to use. I also added an interactive feature,
namely the tip.

## Day 4
Today I added the multiple linechart (see picture).
Because I had a few bugs and I had to wait a long time before Tim came to help me, this
is the only thing I could make today.

Improvents tomorrow: I want to add circles to the lines, where the points are displayed.
And with this an interactive feature that you can see the points (see picture for the circles).
I want to make a buttom where you can chose to display only 1 country, or a few countries at the same time. I also
want to make the axis for the linechart.

Improvements next week: I want to make a legend for the world map and I want to add figures
to my specific info page per coutnry.


## Day 5
Today I added the circles and made axis for the multiple linegraph (see picture).

I deleted the countries in my worldmap which are not in the Europian Union. And I coloured the countries
according to their budget deficit (see picture)

Next week I want to add the slider to the world map, such that you can slide over the years and the colours of the
world-map change (according to their budget deficit that year). I want to make the lines in the line graph the same
colour and if you touch the lines with the mouse, it gives you a different colour. This way you can see specifically how
that line is going, but it is'nt this messy anymore.

Today I also decided what I want for my specific country information page: I want to make a pie chart, which shows which
percentage of the government spendings is spent to a specific sector. I want to add the government spendings also
to that page.

## Day 6 (monday 2nd week)
Kim gave me a tip in the meeting we had (on friday), that it might be more explaining if I showed where the money
in a certain year is spend to (specifically if there is a huge deficit). This information will
be on the specific information page in my website. I found on the website of the OECD
10 sectors where the government spends her money to and it is in percentages of the total spendings.

Today I formatted the data (csv) I found into a json file, and I made a histogram of the data.
After I made the histogram, I saw that the data was in percentages and that was not what I wanted.
I want to show the total amount of money spend to a sector instead of the percentages.
I can solve this because I also have data of the total amount of money spend by the government in each year,
so with this information and with the percentages I can calculate the total amound of money spend to a sector.
I will do this tomorrow, and add the information to the histogram (instead of the percentage information).
I want to display the percentage information in a piechart, I want to make a start with this wednesday.

In the picture below you can see the histogram I made with the percentage info.

## Day 7
Today I found the right data for in my histogram and I made a beginning with the piechart.
Something goes wrong in my piechart, but I don't know what, so I'm going to ask that tomorrow.

I added axis to my histogram, but it is not working good enough.
My margins are not working good enough.  I will ask that tomorrow as well. Picture of my histogram below:

I adjusted my linechart, so that it is not looking very messy anymore. All the lines are
grey and if you put your mouse on the lines, they will turn red, till you move your mouse
somewhere else. Picture of my linechart below:
![schermafbeelding 2019-01-15 om 15 31 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43995505/51186851-d9f28e80-18da-11e9-8590-47341d7899fa.png)
Today my group came together as well, and we made an style guide.
