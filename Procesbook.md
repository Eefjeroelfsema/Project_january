## Day 3
Today I made the page for the specific information and I added the same style to it as the
homepage (via bootstrap). I did this because it makes it look better.

I also divided my homepage in 2 columns, I decided to go for 2 columns because I can now
display the worldmap and the interactive chart set next to each other.

I formatted my csv data into a json file, via my converter (I adjusted the converter
  I made in previous projects to fit on my current data).

Lastly I added the worldmap to my homepage (worldmap-page), and I puzzled a bit
such that now only Europe is displayed as I wanted. I added colours, but not the right one.
Tomorrow I want to figure out which colours I'm going to use. I also added an interactive feature,
namely the tip.
