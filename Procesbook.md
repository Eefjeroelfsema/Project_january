## Day 3
Today I made the page for the specific information and I added the same style to it as the
homepage (via bootstrap). I did this because it makes it look better. See picture below

I also divided my homepage in 2 columns, I decided to go for 2 columns because I can now
display the worldmap and the interactive chart set next to each other.

I formatted my csv data into a json file, via my converter (I adjusted the converter
I made in previous projects to fit on my current data).

Lastly I added the worldmap to my homepage (worldmap-page), and I puzzled a bit
such that now only Europe is displayed as I wanted. I added colours, but not the right one.
Tomorrow I want to figure out which colours I'm going to use. I also added an interactive feature,
namely the tip.

## Day 4
Today I added the multiple linechart (see picture).
Because I had a few bugs and I had to wait a long time before Tim came to help me, this
is the only thing I could make today.

Improvents tomorrow: I want to add circles to the lines, where the points are displayed.
And with this an interactive feature that you can see the points (see picture for the circles).
I want to make a buttom where you can chose to display only 1 country, or a few countries at the same time. I also
want to make the axis for the linechart.

Improvements next week: I want to make a legend for the world map and I want to add figures
to my specific info page per coutnry.


## Day 5
Today I added the circles and made axis for the multiple linegraph (see picture).

I deleted the countries in my worldmap which are not in the Europian Union. And I coloured the countries
according to their budget deficit (see picture)

Next week I want to add the slider to the world map, such that you can slide over the years and the colours of the
world-map change (according to their budget deficit that year). I want to make the lines in the line graph the same
colour and if you touch the lines with the mouse, it gives you a different colour. This way you can see specifically how
that line is going, but it is'nt this messy anymore.

Today I also decided what I want for my specific country information page: I want to make a pie chart, which shows which
percentage of the government spendings is spent to a specific sector. I want to add the government spendings also
to that page.
