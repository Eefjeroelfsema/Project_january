Problem statement:
Every government has a budget deficit in the European Union, 
there are strict rules but there is no clearity for the citizens of the EU if these rules are persued.
Therefore I want to make it clear for the EU citizens.

Solution:
I want to make an datavisualization of the European Union, where it becomes clear what the budget deficits are and if 
they follow the rules. 

In this data visualization I will use the map of the world to display the different information for certain countries. 
I also want to make it possible to click on a certain country and display a lot of additional information over that country 
in a nice visual overview (GDP, government spendings etc.)
