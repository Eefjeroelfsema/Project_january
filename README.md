Map of the EU: the map first drawn is of the year 1995, all the countries are coloured
by their budget deficit that year. There is a slider below the map, where you can change the
year and update the map according to that year. In the legend, added next to the map
it is clear which colour correspondends with which budget deficit percentage.

Multiple linechart: in this visualization I show the historical budget deficits of the countries.
The first linechart drawn is with all the countries together. Via a button next to the title you can
select a certain country and only the line of that country is drawed. The axis move together with
the range of the country values. It is also possible to draw all the lines together again.

- Piechart: in this visualization it is shown which percentage of the total spendings is spent to
a specific sector. The visualizatoin appears when the user clicks on a country in the worldmap.
According to the year and the country the user selects, the piechart is made with that information.
In the middle of the piechart the year and country are shown, when you hover over the charts, the
percentage and the sector are shown.

- Barchart: in this visualization it is shown which percentage of the GDP of that country that year is
spent to a specific sector. The visualizatoin appears next to the piechart when the user clicks on a country in the worldmap.
According to the year and the country the user selects, the barchart is made with that information.

## Purpose
Every government has a budget deficit in the European Union,
there are strict rules but there is no clearity for the citizens of the EU if these rules are persued.
Therefore I want to make it clear for the EU citizens.
