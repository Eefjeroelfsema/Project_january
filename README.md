# Projectproposal Eefje Roelfsema (10993673)

## Problem statement:
Every government has a budget deficit in the European Union,
there are strict rules but there is no clearity for the citizens of the EU if these rules are persued.
Therefore I want to make it clear for the EU citizens.

## Solution:
I want to make an datavisualization of the European Union, where it becomes clear what the budget deficits are and if
they follow the rules.

In this data visualization I will use the map of the world to display the different information for certain countries.
I also want to make it possible to click on a certain country and display a lot of additional information over that country
in a nice visual overview (GDP, government spendings etc.)

In my doc file are a 3 examples of how my data visualisation will look like. In my mainpage I want a map of the EU,
where next to the map there is a list of all the budget deficits of each country of this year. If you click on a country
in the map of the EU, I want to show a infographic with additional information over that country. A historical line graph
of the budget deficits, government spendings GDP etc. there are 2 examples of this in my doc file.

## Minimum features:
- Map of the European union, with list of budget deficits.
- For each country a specific page with additional information.

## Maximum features:
- The amount of information on the specific country pages.
- For every extra additional information, a page where it is visualized for all the countries together
- Some ideas that come in mind when working on this project.

## Data source:
OECD
