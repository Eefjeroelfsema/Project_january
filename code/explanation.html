              <h2> Europian budget deficits</h2>

              <p> <i> Minor programming endproject January 2019; Eefje Roelfsema, 10993673 </i></p>

              <p> Most of the countries in the Europian Union have the euro as their currency.
                Having this many countries using the same currency brings risks; a dicision of 1 country
                may instabilize the euro, which is a problem for the whole of Europe. Therefore the 28 members
                of the Europian Union signed the Stability and Growth pact, which is an agreement to
                acilitate and maintain the stability of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In this
                agreement there are strict rules on how much a country is allowed to spend.
                One of the main rules of this agreement, and also the most debated rule, is that EU-countries
                are not allowed to spend more of 3% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year.
                That means that if your budget deficit is smaller than -3%, you're following this rule of the
                Stability and Growth pact.

            <p> Due to the financial crisis that hit Europe in the end of 2008, it became too difficult
                for most countries to maintain the rules of the Stability and Growth pact. Countries spended too much
                to get their economy out of this recession. Countries who usually did not violate the pact,
                came under special supervision of the EU.
                Since then there is a lot of uncertainty about the budget deficits of Europian Union countries.
                On this website I try to create clarity on this topic. </p>

            <h4> Map of the Europian Union </h4>
            <p> On my homepage their is a Europian Union map, that shows the budget deficit of each country via the colour.
                Via the slider below this map, you can change the year you are interested in. Next to the worldmap
                there is a legend, which explains which colour
                corresponds to which budget deficit percentage. In short: </p>

            <p>   <b> - Green colour </b> : a country has a positive budget deficit, they're following the rules of the Europian
                Union. A positive budget deficit also means that they're spending less than they're receving.
                This is also positive. </p>

            <p>   <b> - Yellow colour </b> : a country has a negative budget deficit, but it is between 0% and -3%.
                They are following the rules of the Europian Union, nevertheless they are still spending more than
                they are receiving. </p>

            <p>   <b> - Red colour </b> :  a country has a negative budget deficit and it is lower than -3%.
                This means that a country is not following the rules of the Europian Union. The more red a country is
                the bigger the higher their budget deficit, which is a bad thing.</p>

            <h4> Historical budget deficit linechart </h4>
            <p> If you are interested in the budget deficits of Europian Union countries over the year,
              there is a historical linegraph. You can look at all the countries together, but it is also possible
              to focus on one country in particular when you push the button.</p>

            <h4> Government Spendings </h4>

            <p> A budget deficit is caused by spending too much money. Therefore I made it visible
            for each country in each year what they're spending. You can also see to which sectors
            the governemnt is spending the money to.
             </p>
             <h6> Percentage to sectors </h6>
             <p> In the piechart is shown which percentage of the total spendings is spend to a specific sector </p>

             <h6> Spendings in percentage of the GDP </h6>
             <p> In the barchart is visible how many percent of the GDP is spend to certain sectors.
               The sectors have the same colour in the piechart and in the barchart </p>

            <h4> Data </h4>
              <p> I got all my data from the OECD database: https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-deficit.htm#indicator-chart </p>
